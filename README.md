#ðŸ§  Deep Learning for Computer Vision: Cat vs. Dog Classification
##ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:
This project implements a deep learning model for binary image classification, distinguishing between cats and dogs. The model is trained on a smaller, curated dataset to test the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) even with limited data.
